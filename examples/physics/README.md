This example demonstrates the physics system in the Immersive Web SDK (IWSDK), showcasing realistic physics simulation powered by the Babylon Havok physics engine. Learn how to create interactive physics-enabled objects with various shapes, motion types, and physical properties.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This example demonstrates:

- **Physics System Integration**: Setting up the Havok physics engine in your IWSDK application
- **Physics Bodies**: Creating objects with different motion types (Static, Dynamic, Kinematic)
- **Physics Shapes**: Using various collision shapes (Sphere, Box, Cylinder, ConvexHull, TriMesh, Auto-detect)
- **Physics Manipulation**: Applying forces and impulses to physics objects
- **Interactive Physics**: Combining physics with the grabbing system for interactive objects
- **Physical Properties**: Configuring density, friction, restitution, damping, and gravity factors

### Scene Contents

The example includes:

1. **Environment (Desk)**: Static TriMesh physics body that serves as the floor/surface
2. **Plant (Sansevieria)**: Dynamic physics object with auto-detected shape, increased gravity factor, and linear damping
3. **Drone**: Dynamic physics object with auto-detected shape, standard physics properties
4. **Robot**: Grabbable object (no physics) for comparison

## ⚙️ Physics System Overview

### Enabling Physics

Enable physics in your world configuration:

```javascript
World.create(document.getElementById('scene-container'), {
  features: {
    physics: true,  // Enable Havok physics engine
    grabbing: true,  // Enable object grabbing
    locomotion: true,  // Enable player movement
  },
});
```

### Physics Components

The physics system uses three main ECS components:

#### 1. PhysicsBody

Defines the motion type and physical behavior of an entity. See `immersive-web-sdk/packages/core/src/physics/physicsBody.ts:47-66`

**Motion Types** (`PhysicsState`):
- **`Static`**: Immovable objects like walls and floors. Affects other bodies but never moves.
- **`Dynamic`**: Objects that respond to forces, collisions, and gravity.
- **`Kinematic`**: Programmatically controlled objects that push dynamic bodies but aren't affected by physics.

**Properties**:
- `state`: Motion type (default: `PhysicsState.Dynamic`)
- `linearDamping`: Reduces linear velocity over time (default: 0.0)
- `angularDamping`: Reduces angular velocity over time (default: 0.0)
- `gravityFactor`: Multiplier for gravity effect (default: 1.0)
- `centerOfMass`: Custom center of mass offset (default: auto-calculated)

**Example**:
```javascript
entity.addComponent(PhysicsBody, {
  state: PhysicsState.Dynamic,
  linearDamping: 0.5,
  gravityFactor: 2.0,
});
```

#### 2. PhysicsShape

Defines the collision shape and material properties. See `immersive-web-sdk/packages/core/src/physics/physicsShape.ts:80-100`

**Shape Types** (`PhysicsShapeType`):
- **`Sphere`**: Defined by radius in `dimensions[0]`. Efficient for round objects.
- **`Box`**: Defined by `[width, height, depth]` in dimensions. Good for rectangular objects.
- **`Cylinder`**: Defined by radius in `dimensions[0]` and height in `dimensions[1]`.
- **`ConvexHull`**: Auto-generates a convex wrapper around the mesh. Great balance of accuracy and performance.
- **`TriMesh`**: Uses exact mesh geometry. Most accurate but computationally expensive. Best for static objects.
- **`Auto`**: Automatically detects the best shape from Three.js geometry (SphereGeometry → Sphere, BoxGeometry → Box, etc.)

**Material Properties**:
- `density`: Mass per unit volume (default: 1.0)
- `restitution`: Bounciness, 0 = no bounce, 1 = perfect bounce (default: 0.0)
- `friction`: Surface friction (default: 0.5)

**Example**:
```javascript
entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {
  shape: PhysicsShapeType.Sphere,
  dimensions: [0.5, 0, 0],  // radius = 0.5 meters
  density: 2.0,
  restitution: 0.8,  // bouncy
  friction: 0.1,     // slippery
});
```

#### 3. PhysicsManipulation

Applies one-time forces or velocity changes to a physics body. The component is automatically removed after application. See `immersive-web-sdk/packages/core/src/physics/physicsManipulation.ts:37-48`

**Properties**:
- `force`: Impulse force vector `[x, y, z]`
- `linearVelocity`: Set linear velocity directly `[x, y, z]`
- `angularVelocity`: Set angular velocity directly `[x, y, z]`

**Example**:
```javascript
// Apply an impulse force
entity.addComponent(PhysicsManipulation, {
  force: [10, 5, 0],  // Push right and up
});
```

### Code Example

Here's how the example creates a dynamic sphere with physics (from `src/index.js:44-60`):

```javascript
// Create a sphere mesh
const body = new Mesh(
  new SphereGeometry(0.2),
  new MeshStandardMaterial({
    side: FrontSide,
    color: new Color(Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random()),
  }),
);
body.position.set(-1, 1.5, 0.5);
scene.add(body);

// Create entity and add physics
const entity = world.createTransformEntity(body);
entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {
  shape: PhysicsShapeType.Sphere,
  dimensions: [0.2],
});
entity.addComponent(PhysicsBody, {
  state: PhysicsState.Dynamic
});
entity.addComponent(PhysicsManipulation, {
  force: [10, 1, 1]
});
```

### Physics in GLXF Scenes

You can also configure physics components directly in Meta Spatial Editor by opening `immersive-web-sdk/examples/physics/metaspatial/Main.metaspatial`:

- The **environment desk** uses a static TriMesh shape for accurate collisions
- The **plant** has a dynamic body with `gravityFactor: 2.0` and `linearDamping: 1.0`
- The **drone** has a standard dynamic body with auto-detected shape
- All objects are combined with `DistanceGrabbable` for VR interaction

## 📦 Asset Organization

### WebXR-Optimized Asset Handling

This example uses Vite's `public/` directory for WebXR assets since they are:

- Loaded at runtime via URLs (not imported as modules)
- Large files that shouldn't be bundled or processed
- Need direct URL access for asset loaders

### Assets Directory Structure

- **`public/gltf/`** - 3D models in GLTF/GLB format
- **`public/glxf/`** - GLXF scene files containing component data
- **`public/textures/`** - Images, textures, and visual assets (.png, .jpg, etc.)
- **`public/audio/`** - Sound effects and music files
- **`public/models/`** - Other 3D model formats

### Asset Usage

```javascript
// Reference assets using root-relative paths (Vite serves public/ at root)
const assets = {
  scene: { url: '/glxf/my-scene.glxf', type: AssetType.GLXF },
  model: { url: '/gltf/my-model.gltf', type: AssetType.GLTF },
  texture: { url: '/textures/my-texture.png', type: AssetType.Texture },
};
```

## 🔧 Component System

### Generated Components

The `generated/components/` directory contains XML definitions for all framework components. These files are:

- **Generated automatically** during development
- **Committed to version control** for designer/artist accessibility
- **Used by Meta Spatial** for component integration

### Generated Files Organization

The `generated/` folder organizes all auto-generated files:

- **`generated/components/`** - Component XML definitions
- **Future**: Schema files, type definitions, documentation, etc.

### Important Notes

- All generated files should be committed to ensure the project works out-of-the-box
- Designers and tech artists can use these without running build commands
- Files are regenerated when components change during development

## 🌐 WebXR Development

### HTTPS Requirements

WebXR requires HTTPS for all features to work properly. This example includes:

- Automatic HTTPS certificate generation via `vite-plugin-mkcert`
- Self-signed certificates for local development
- Proper CORS configuration for asset loading

### Testing on Devices

```bash
# Find your local IP
ipconfig getifaddr en0  # macOS
# or
hostname -I             # Linux

# Access from VR headset
https://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8081
```

## 💡 Best Practices & Tips

### Choosing the Right Shape Type

- **Use `Auto`** for rapid prototyping and most cases - it intelligently selects the best shape
- **Use `Sphere`** for balls, projectiles, or any round objects - most efficient collision shape
- **Use `Box`** for crates, walls, floors - simple and performant
- **Use `ConvexHull`** for irregular dynamic objects - good balance of accuracy and performance
- **Use `TriMesh`** mostly for static environments - exact mesh collision but expensive for dynamic objects

### Performance Optimization

1. **Prefer simpler shapes**: Sphere and Box are faster than ConvexHull and TriMesh
2. **Use Static bodies for environments**: Static bodies are much cheaper than Dynamic/Kinematic
3. **Limit TriMesh to static objects**: TriMesh vs TriMesh collisions are very expensive
4. **Apply damping for stability**: Use `linearDamping` and `angularDamping` to prevent runaway motion
5. **Adjust gravity factor**: Use `gravityFactor` instead of mass to control how objects fall

### Debugging Physics

- Use the browser console to check for physics errors
- Verify that objects have both `PhysicsBody` and `PhysicsShape` components
- Check that `physics: true` is enabled in your World configuration
- Ensure your models have valid geometry for collision detection

## 🛠 Customization

### Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.js` file includes:

- HTTPS development server setup
- Static asset copying configuration
- Build optimization settings
- Asset handling rules

### Adding New Assets

1. Place assets in the appropriate `public/` subdirectory
2. Reference them in your code using root-relative paths (e.g., `/gltf/model.gltf`)
3. Assets are automatically served by Vite during development and copied to build output
